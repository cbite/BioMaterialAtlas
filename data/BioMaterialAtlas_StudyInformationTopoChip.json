Cell expansion depends both on the initial number of attaching cells to the surface directly after seeding the cell suspension and the rate of proliferation after attachment. A low number of attaching cells can have a very rapid rate of proliferation but this would not be revealed by performing a long term experiment. On the other hand, a high number of attaching cells could have a very low rate of proliferation, giving the false impression of a high rate of cell expansion when measured after few days of cell growth. To best investigate the rate of ADSC expansion we therefore aimed to test both the attachment shortly after seeding (6 hours) and compare this with the cell number after proliferation (4 days). The aim was to identify topographies that maximize cell expansion.; Lead author: J. van Ark ; Lead principal investigator: B.

Current in vitro and in vivo models have a poor ability to predict cardiotoxicity of drugs in patients, leading to the market release of potentially lethal drugs and the attrition of valuable drugs. Current in vitro toxicity screens rely on the artificial expression of single cardiac ion channels in genetically transformed cell lines which do not accurately model pertinent genetic, cellular, or biochemical characteristics. To improve the accuracy of toxicity screening, preclinical drug tests ideally would be conducted on adult human cardiomyocytes (CMs). Unfortunately, this has not been feasible in early stage drug discovery due to the difficulties in obtaining cardiac tissue from patients and the inability to propagate these cells in culture. The recent derivation of human CMs from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) represents a possible method to circumvent these hurdles, because hiPSs possess many of the same electrical characteristics as primary human CMs and can be generated in unlimited quantities from pluripotent cell sources. The recent Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) is a novel safety screening proposal that incorporates iPS-derived cardiomyocytes with the aim to assess the risk of new drugs to induce arrhythmia. However, there are still concerns about the quality of current commercial iPS-derived CMs. They are not highly pure populations of ventricular CMs and they don\u2019t appear to fully recapitulate the electrophysiological features of native healthy human CMs and have not always responded, as expected, to established proarrhythmic agents. The presence of premature cardiomyocytes is likely to have a negative effect on the cardiac function of this model. Therefore, functional cardiomyocytes at a developmental stage comparable to that of human adult ventricular cells will be required.;Lead author: J. van Ark; Lead principal investigator:B.

However, currently used bioprosthetic transcatheter valves are prone to progressive dysfunctional degeneration, limiting their use in younger patients. To overcome these limitations, the concept of tissue engineered heart valves with self-repair capacity has been introduced as next-generation technology. For the first time, the feasibility and long-term functionality of transcatheter-based homologous off-the-shelf tissue engineered heart valves are demonstrated in a relevant pre-clinical model. Such engineered heart valves may represent an interesting alternative to current prostheses because of their rapid cellular repopulation, tissue remodeling, and therewith self-repair capacity. The concept of homologous off-the-shelf tissue engineered heart valves may therefore substantially simplify previous tissue engineering concepts toward clinical translation. ; Lead author: Driessen-Mol (2014) and Emmert (2018); Lead Principal investigator: Team 1) TU\/e, Xeltis and UHZ team 2) UHZ, Xletis, and Berlin","StudyDesign":"Type:Heart valve;Scaffold:PGA\/p4HB scaffold in nitinol stent (old design);Implantation method:Minimally invasive implantation (transapical+transvenous); Implantation position: Pulmonary position; Follow-up: 1,8,16, and 24 weeks","CellCulture":"Cell type:Autologous vascular dereived myofibroblasts in fibrin gel","StudyResults":null},{"Name":"Encapsulation","Date":"2014","SecondaryScreening":"Not available","RawImages":"Encapsulation_DAPI_001.png,Encapsulation_TXRED_001.png","SegmentationImages":"Encapsulation_seg_001.png,Encapsulation_seg_002.png","StudyDescription":"Description:TopoChip screening is performed to assess possible beneficial orchestration of the foreign body response by topographies.

Current in vitro models of liver related diseases do not consider how topographical features used for cell culture can greatly impact different aspects of cell behavior such as cell differentiation, proliferation and survival. In this work we propose the use of a custom designed polystyrene cell culture surface topography that does enable long-term cultivation of primary hepatocytes with maintenance of phenotypical stability and viability. Our results show that hepatocytes cultured on topographies can maintain the expression of hepatic genetic markers alongside a strongly enhanced protein production capacity, drug metabolism functionality and sensitivity to toxins compared to current in vitro liver models for up to 4 weeks. Our custom made topographic-featuring plates can be used easily with existing standardized cell culture protocols representing an innovative and powerful tool for long-term in vitro studies using primary hepatocytes within routine high-throughput screenings and for more specific disease models including infection.;Lead author: J. de Boer;Lead principal investigator: J. de Boer; Date: 2018","StudyDesign":"Technology:TopoChip; Material:Polystyrene TopoChip;Coating: None; Replicates: 10;Cell staining:\"Dapi (Nuclei), CD81 (Hepatocyte marker), CellMaskOrange (Cellbody)\"","CellCulture":"CellType:Hepatocytes;Culture time:30 days","StudyResults":"Selected surfaces:2177,887,2039,359,956,201,1033,824,135,1757,564,8,1594,1213,1857"},{"Name":"Phenome28","Date":"2014","SecondaryScreening":"Adipogenesis; ALP induction; Cell Proliferation; Protein synthesis; Apopotosis; Live imaging; CellPainting Asay; Transcriptional profiling","RawImages":null,"SegmentationImages":"Phenome28_seg1;Phenome28_seg2;Phenome28_seg3","StudyDescription":"Description: We defined the phenotypic response of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to 2176 randomly generated surface topographies by probing basic functions such as migration, proliferation, protein synthesis, apoptosis, and differentiation using quantitative image analysis.

Following minimally invasive trans-apical implantation into an ovine model, TEHVs showed adequate in-vivo functionality, but a thickening of the leaflets was observed. In order to evaluate the impact of the substantial tissue deformations of TEHVs associated with the crimping procedure during minimally invasive delivery, trans-apical and conventional implantation technologies were compared in an ovine model.This direct comparison of trans-apical and conventional surgical implantation techniques showed that crimping had no adverse effect on the integrity or functional outcome of TEHVs. This suggests that a thickening of TEHVs in vivo is neither caused by nor enhanced by the crimping procedure, but represents a functional tissue remodeling process.;Lead author: P.E.
