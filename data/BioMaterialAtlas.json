			"Summary": "Stem cells respond to the physicochemical parameters of the substrate on which they grow. Quantitative material activity relationships ethe relationships between substrate parameters and the phenotypes they induce have so far poorly predicted the success of bioactive implant surfaces. In this report, we screened a library of randomly selected designed surface topographies for those inducing osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Cell shape features, surface design parameters, and osteogenic marker expression were strongly correlated in vitro. Furthermore, the surfaces with the highest osteogenic potential in vitro also demonstrated their osteogenic effect in vivo: these indeed strongly enhanced bone bonding in a rabbit femur model. Our work shows that by giving stem cells specific physicochemical parameters through designed surface topographies, differentiation of these cells can be dictated."

Undifferentiated TSCs were seeded on a TopoChip containing 2176 different topographies in culture medium without differentiation factors, then monitored cell morphology and the levels of ICAM-1, a marker of FRC differentiation. We identified 112 and 72 surfaces that upregulated and downregulated, respectively, ICAM-1 expression.

			"Summary": "The nanotopography of biomaterial surfaces can be modified to influence adhering cells with the aim to improve the performance of medical implants and tissue culture substrates. However, the necessary knowledge of the underlying mechanisms remains incomplete. One reason for this is the limited availability of high-resolution nanotopographies on relevant biomaterials, suitable to conduct systematic biological studies. The present study shows the fabrication of a library of nano-sized surface topographies with high fidelity. The potential of this library, called the \u2018NanoTopoChip\u2019 is shown in a proof of principle HTS study which demonstrates how cells are affected by nanotopographies. The large dataset, acquired by quantitative high-content imaging, allowed us to use predictive modeling to describe how feature dimensions affect cell morphology."

On the Nano-TopoChip, we do not observe gross differences in cellular shapes but the nanotopographies seem to affect the extent of cell spreading and the organization of the actin localization. On the nano features, the actin fibers align in various different orientations and patterns. On the nano features, the actin fibers align in various different orientations and patterns.  The more spread cells have very distinct punctate patterns of actin fibers, while the less spread cells tend to have more cortical actin. In this initial observation, the morphology of U2OS nuclei does not seem to deviate much from the common \u2018classic\u2019 oval shape.",
			"Nanotopography \u2013 cell morphology relationships": "We found that random forest was able to predict cell area most accurately (Fig. 5c). The area of the smallest individual structure, the 10th percentile of pillars size within the topography and the ratio between area covered by topographical features and the area not covered by topographical features (pattern density) calculated by 2 methods were the most predictive parameters. These surface design parameters were able to predict cell size with 98% accuracy (Fig. 5d). Visual inspection of the topography designs confirms the model predictions (Fig. 5e). The topographies that induce small, more rounded cells, consist of relatively large topographies with large spacing between the topographies. The topographies which induce more spreading of the cells consist of smaller features which also cover a relatively small area. Other parameters such as cell number, actin localization and fiber actin alignment could also be predicted by feature design parameters."

			"Description": "Because Scxa is a TGF-\u03b2 responsive gene, we investigated the link between mechanotransduction and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. We discovered that mesenchymal stem cells exposed to both micro-topographies and TGF-\u03b22 display synergistic induction of SMAD phosphorylation and transcription of the TGF-\u03b2 target genes SCX, a-SMA, and SOX9. Pharmacological perturbations revealed that Rho/ROCK/SRF signaling is required for this synergistic response. We further found an activation of the early response genes SRF and EGR1 during the early adaptation phase on micro-topographies, which coincided with higher expression of the TGF-\u03b2 type-II receptor gene. Of interest, PKC activators Prostratin and Ingenol-3, known for inducing actin reorganization and activation of serum response elements, were able to mimic the topography-induced TGF-\u03b2 response.

At 2 h, we found increased EGR1 levels in the nucleus when MSCs are cultured on PS-1018 compared to flat. Of interest, we measured a slight yet non-significant increase at 24 hours. Similar to EGR1, high intensities of nuclear SRF were observed at 2 hours, followed by a slight yet non-significant decrease at 24 hours compared to the flat surface.",
			"TGF-\u03b2R-II and SCX levels in MSCs": "The micro-topographies enhance SCX levels in MSCs, which could be guided by a general sensitization for TGF-\u03b2 signaling through SRF, EGR1 and TGF-\u03b2R-II. We confirmed increased TGF-\u03b2R-II expression on surface PS-1018 by qPCR after 8 hours (1.3 fold change), and reaching a maximum at 24 hours. At 48 hours, no significant differences in TGF-\u03b2R-II levels were detected between PS-1018 and flat. It is known that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as U0216, can inhibit the activation of its downstream target EGR1, which we experimentally verified. U0216 also decreased TGF-\u03b2R-II expression on the PS-1018 surface.",

Besides SCX, we also found a similar effect for other TGF-\u03b2 responsive genes. Expression of \u03b1-SMA, a differentiation marker of smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts, and the chondrogenic transcription factor SOX9 can be induced by TGF-\u03b22, and display a synergistic effect when combined with micro-topographies.Rho/ROCK/SRF signaling and topography-induced TGF-\u03b2 sensitization. Inhibitors against the TGF-\u03b2 receptor abolish SCX levels on all conditions including PS-1018, emphasizing the involvement of TGF-\u03b2 signaling for micro-topographical induction of SCX. The Rho/ROCK/SRF inhibitors Y27632, CCG-209371, and blebbistatin abolishes the topography-induced effect on SCX expression. he MAPK/MEK inhibitor U0216 reduces overall SCX expression, yet does not reduce the synergistic effect on SCX expression.

Without TGF-\u03b22, ingenol and prostratin induced similar SCX levels as the PS-1018 surface. n the presence of TGF-\u03b22, prostratin induced a 36.2 fold SCX expression compared to a regular flat surface without TGF-\u03b22. Ingenol-3 induced a similar response, with slightly higher SCX levels (39.1 fold change) than prostratin. No significant differences between the topography and PKC activators were observed when adding TGF-\u03b22. These findings demonstrate that PKC activators strikingly mimic the effect of the micro-topography in inducing SCX levels."

			"Description": "We used well established techniques to compare hMSCs cultured on flat and topographically enhanced polystyreneand observed dramatically changed cell morphologies accompanied by shrinkage of cytoplasm and nucleus, a decreased overall cellular metabolism, and slower cell cycle progression resulting in a lower proliferation rate in cells exposed to surface topographies. We hypothesized that this reduction in proliferation rate effects their sensitivity to certain cancer drugs, which was confirmed by higher survival rate of hMSCs cultured on topographies exposed to paclitaxel. Thus, micro-topographies can be used as a model system to mimic the natural cell micro-environment, and be a powerful tool to optimize cell treatment in vitro."

For time-lapse imaging of fluorescently labeled U2OS cells (GFP-Actin) on topographically enhanced substrates, z-stacks of confocal images were taken every 5\u2009minutes. Here, the three-dimensional reconstructed time-lapse confocal images were obtained using an upright Carl Zeiss LSM 700 with a humidified 5% CO2 chambers at 37 degrees Celcius. ",
			"Cell volume and size quantification": "To quantify cell volume, hMSCs we trypsinized after 24\u2009hours of culture, and quickly washed before direct measurements in the flow cytometer (BD Accuri C6). Cell size was measured using the forward scatter.",

			"hMSCs on surface topographies": "After seeding, hMSCs mostly adhere in the valleys, and are thus surrounded by 10\u2009\u00b5m high topographical features. hMSCs changed both their cell and nuclear morphology dramatically compared to the flat reference as seen after 3 days of culture. e observed strongly elongated cells with nuclei which seemed to be compressed and smaller in size. On topo M, cell shape was defined by long perpendicular structures, whereas cells on topo L tended to follow contact guidance into only one direction without branches. Cells on surface S however tended to produce structures into multiple directions with many branches. The width of the cell body correlated with the distance between the topographical features. Quantitative imaging of cells cultured on flat and the three topographies revealed a two-fold reduction of cell area as well as nuclear area.",
			"Nuclear and total cell volume": " we assessed the deformation of the nuclei on the three topographies with varying topographical feature size (S, M, and L) after 72\u2009hours of culture. Again, we observed a strong adaptation of cells on the different topographies. For all three assessed topographies, cells reduced the volumes of their nuclei up to 2.5-fold.",
			"Gene expression analysis": "The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on the three topographies, compared to the flat reference, revealed genes which were unique for one specific topography, had an overlap with two topographies and DEGs found for all three topographie relative to the unpatterned, flat substrate. he overlapping DEGs between the three topographies are thus typical for hMSCs which are adapting to a topographically enhanced microenvironment.",
			"Metabolic activity": "We observed a lower metabolic activity already after 24\u2009h on all three topographies relative to flat. Where the metabolism of cells on flat surfaces remained constant, metabolism was lowered three-fold in cells exposed to topographies over a period of 7 days, suggesting a topography-dependent adaption process.",
			"Cell cycle and topography": "We observed a 2.5-fold decrease in proliferation rates in the smaller cells cultured on surface topographies. Furthermore, assessment of the cell cycle distribution revealed a higher prevalence of cells in the G0/G1-phase accompanied by a decrease in the number of cells in S-phase for cells cultured on surface topographies.",
			"hMSCs on topographies exposed to paclitaxel": "We exposed hMSCs for 44\u2009hours to a range of paclitaxel concentrations and chose 300\u2009\u00b5M paclitaxel, which resulted in a 75% reduction of cell number compared to hMSCs cultured in basic medium after 44\u2009hours. Next, compared cell survival between a flat control surface and hMSCs cultures on topography M, and observed that two times more cells remained alive after the paclitaxel treatment when being exposed to surface topography. he effect of topography to paclitaxel sensitivity was further confirmed with the analogous microtubule-stabilizing drug docetaxel."

			"Description": "Macrophages play a central role in orchestrating immune responses to foreign materials, which are often responsible for the failure of implanted medical devices. Material topography is known to influence macrophage attachment and phenotype, providing opportunities for the rational design of \u201cimmune-instructive\u201d topographies to modulate macrophage function and thus foreign body responses to biomaterials. A high throughput screening approach is therefore utilized to investigate the relationship between topography and human monocyte\u2013derived macrophage attachment and phenotype, using a diverse library of 2176 micropatterns generated by an algorithm. This reveals that micropillars 5\u201310 \u00b5m in diameter play a dominant role in driving macrophage attachment compared to the many other topographies screened, an observation that aligns with studies of the interaction of macrophages with particles."

Thereafter, valve closure was incomplete in line with the observed central regurgitation.",
			"Histology": "Prior to implantation the TEHVs revealed no cellular remnants and a well-developed extracellular matrix, mainly consisting of collagen demonstrating an efficient decellularization procedure. After TEHV deployment in the pulmonary position endogenous cellular repopulation occurred rapidly with first signs of cell infiltration as early as 5 h after implantation. The valvular tissues demonstrated abundant amounts of collagen that increased in density over time, in particular in the hinge area and wall, and to a lesser extent in the leaflets. Elastic matrix formation was evident in the wall at 8 weeks and later time points. In the hinge area the formation of elastic fibers was visible after 16 weeks and in the leaflets at 24 weeks. Calcification was not detected in any of the valves.",

Differences between explants. Direct comparison of the degree of collagen alignment in the explants and the computational model indicated a monotonic relationship between the measured alignment in the explants and the predicted collagen alignment from the simulations, indicating that our predictive model sufficiently captured the differences in remodeling observed in vivo.

			"Description": "The creation of a living heart valve is a much-wanted alternative for current valve prostheses that suffer from limited durability and thromboembolic complications. Current strategies to create such valves, however, require the use of cells for in vitro culture, or decellularized human- or animal-derived donor tissue for in situ engineering. Here, we propose and demonstrate proof-of-concept of in situ heart valve tissue engineering using a synthetic approach, in which a cell-free, slow degrading elastomeric valvular implant is populated by endogenous cells to form new valvular tissue inside the heart. We designed a fibrous valvular scaffold, fabricated from a novel supramolecular elastomer, that enables endogenous cells to enter and produce matrix. Orthotopic implantations as pulmonary valve in sheep demonstrated sustained functionality up to 12 months, while the implant was gradually replaced by a layered collagen and elastic matrix in pace with cell-driven polymer resorption. Our results offer new perspectives for endogenous heart valve replacement starting from a readily-available synthetic graft that is compatible with surgical and transcatheter implantation procedures."

However, one of the 12 months explants did show retraction of all cusps, leading to grade 3 regurgitation.",
			"In situ colonization": "Macrophages and neutrophilic granulocytes infiltrated abundantly throughout the porous microstructure of the scaffold, including the leaflet tip, already after 2 months. This was more pronounced in the 6-months explants and decreased from 6 to 12 months. In addition, cells adhered onto the scaffold, forming a layer of neo-tissue, first on the pulmonary surface of the leaflet, and after 12 months also on the ventricular side. Vimentin expression was observed dispersed throughout the scaffold in both the 6- and 12-months explants. \u03b1-SMA positive cells localized at the leaflet base and belly, predominantly in the neo-tissue that had formed on the pulmonary side of the valve at 6 months follow-up. After 12 months, \u03b1-SMA expression in the leaflet tended to be dampened (not statistically significant), while vimentin expression remained abundant. CD45 positive cells were detected throughout the valve leaflets at both 6- and 12 months follow-up.",
			"Progressive in situ endothelialization of valves": "After 6 months in vivo, endothelialization was predominantly observed on the pulmonary side of the leaflet, with expression comparable to the native leaflet. On the ventricular side, patchy endothelium was detected near the hinge region, but not near the free edge. After 12 months, a near-confluent endothelial layer was observed on both the pulmonary and the ventricular surfaces, although localized uncovered regions were detected, mainly near the free edge.",
			"Formation and composition of neo-tissue": "Analogous to the cell colonization, profound valve remodeling was seen at the tissue level. . At 6 months follow-up, collagen was mainly deposited as a neo-tissue layer onto the scaffold the pulmonary side of the leaflet. Minor collagen deposition was detected inside the scaffold, in particular near the hinge region. At 12 months follow-up, collagen deposition inside the scaffold was more pronounced, also in the belly region, and a remodeling region was observed near the hinge region.GAGs were observed in and on the scaffold at both the 6- and the 12-months explants. Biochemical analysis revealed no significant differences in tissue composition between 6- and 12-months explants, although collagen content at 6 months was less than native. At 12 months follow-up, the tissue was composed of DNA, GAGs, collagen, and (tropo)elastin at concentrations comparable to the native pulmonary leaflet.",
			"Elastic fiber formation": "Expression of the (tropo)elastin protein strongly co-localized with collagen expression. At 6 months, coexpression of fibrillin-1 and (tropo)elastin and mature elastic fibers were only detected on the pulmonary side of the leaflet. At 12 months, elastic fiber formation was observed on both sides of the leaflet, albeit more pronounced on the pulmonary side. On the ventricular side, elastic fiber formation was limited to the hinge region.",
			"Scaffold degradation": "The remaining polymer scaffold displayed a modest decrease in molecular weight, but a clear change in the molecular weight distribution (dispersity D), indicating that the remaining material has been affected. Histological analysis revealed that, after 12 months, the PC-BU had specifically disappeared from the section at the base of the leaflet, a section in which cells are relatively abundant.",
			"Mechanical propoerties explants": "Starting from an almost linear elastic material behavior of the PC-BU starter matrix, the explanted valves displayed a more tissue-like non-linear elastic behavior, albeit with a higher stiffness compared to the native pulmonary valve.",

			"Description": "This study showed that bone marrow mononuclear cell pre-seeding had detrimental effects on functionality and in situ remodeling of bioresorbable bisurea-modified polycarbonate (PC-BU)-based tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHVs) used as transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement in sheep. We also showed heterogeneous valve and leaflet remodeling, which affects PC-BU TEHV safety, challenging their potential for clinical translation. We suggest that bone marrow mononuclear cell pre-seeding should not be used in combination with PC-BU TEHVs. A better understanding of cell\u2013scaffold interaction and in situ remodeling processes is needed to improve transcatheter valve design and polymer absorption rates for a safe and clinically relevant translation of this approach."

			"Implantation method": "Minimally invasive transapical",
			"Implantation position": "Pulmonary position",
			"Scaffold": "PCU-131 scaffold in nitinol stent (pre-shaped with insert) with and without bone marrow mononuclear cells.",
			"Cell Culture": "Autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated via density gradient centrifugation from bone marrow aspirate were seeded onto the scaffolds (n=8).",
			"In vivo valve functionality assessment": "Transesophageal echocardiography was used post-operatively and at 4,12, and 24 weeks'follow-up to verify tissue engineered heart valve functionality.  Invasive catheter-based pressure measurements were performed to assess the presence of stenonis.",
			"Explant evaluation": "Tissue samples of explanted valve leaflets are used for gene expression analysis of chemoattractant, anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory, calcification, and ECM-related genes.",
			"Tissue Enginereed heart valve leaflet dimensions": "For each leaflet of the valves explanted after 18 and 24 weeks, valve thickness and leaflet length were measured  from 3 distinct histological sections and in 4 locations per section: lower wall, leaflet base, leaflet middle region (leaflet mid), and leaflet tip.",
			"Semiquantitative evaluation of histology": "2 independent observers performed a semi-quantitative evaluation of the histology by grading different remodeling (neointimal growth, scaffold remnants, elastogenesis, calcifications, and vascularization) and phenotype (endothelial cells, contractile cells, interstitial cells, and macrophages) characteristics of the explants from 0 (no expression) to 5 (high expression).  For each valve leaflet, the semi-quantification was performed in 4 locations per section: lower wall, leaflet base, leaflet middle region (leaflet mid), and leaflet tip."

		"Results": {
			"Acute in vivo performance": "Acute functionality was sufficient for all animals during the 4-h follow-up, with no stenosis and no central or paravalvular leakage independent of the pre-seeding.",
			"Chronic in vivo performance": "At implantation and after 4 weeks, the BM-TEHVs presented with sufficient valve functionality, without stenosis or regurgitation. Two animals were euthanized pre-term after 18 weeks because Transesophageal echocardiography indicated worsening performance over time, starting at 12 weeks\u2019 post-implantation, with moderate to severe regurgitation but no signs of stenosis. All the animals receiving nonseeded PC-BU TEHVs completed their designated follow-up. For these valves, post-operative and 4-week follow-up Transesophageal echocardiography showed functional valves in all animals. with normal leaflet movement and excellent coaptation with no (n = 4) or only trivial (n = 1) regurgitation and low transvalvular pressure gradients",
			"Gross explant evaluation": "BMMNC pre-seeded and nonseeded TEHVs explanted after 4 weeks showed signs of stent integration with the pulmonary artery with intact, pliable leaflets.",
			"Histological evaluation": "Histological evaluation of samples harvested after 4 weeks confirmed cellularization and neo-collagen formation mainly in the lower wall region for both pre-seeded and nonsseded valves. For both pre-seeded and nonseeded valves, vimentin-positive host cells were detected at the interface between the pannus and the scaffold material. Early signs of scaffold degradation were observed in the lower wall and hinge regions and were associated with tissue thickening and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive and vimentin-positive cells. CD31-positive cells were sparse and endothelialization incomplete at 4 weeks.",
			"Gene expression profiling": "Gene expression profiles show differences between the pre-seeded and nonseeded valves, with a higher expression of chemoattractant (CXCL12), pro-inflammatory (transforming growth factor [TGF]-\u03b21), pro-calcification (bone morphogenetic protein-2 and B-GLAP), and matrix remodeling (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-1 and MMP-9) genes in the BM-TEHVs explants compared with the nonseeded valves. Intervalve and interleaflet variability was observed as well, with differential gene expression profiles between valves of the same group and between leaflets of the same valve.",
			"Differential leaflet remodeling within the same valve explant": "PC-BU TEHVs remodeling proved to be animal- and leaflet-specific, independent of BMMNC pre-seeding. Differential leaflet remodeling was also observed in the gene expression profile of each single leaflet harvested from pre-seeded or nonseeded TEHVs.",
			"Semiquantitative evaluation of pre-seeded and nonseeded TEHVS": "Generally, thickening (thickness value >1,000 \u03bcm) was observed in the lower wall and hinge areas of the leaflets, whereas minimal tissue deposition was observed toward the free edges. However, explant thickness measured in different leaflet regions proved to be significantly different among leaflets of the same valve."
