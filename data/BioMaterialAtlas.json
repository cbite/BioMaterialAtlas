Quantitative material activity relationships ethe relationships between substrate parameters and the phenotypes they induce have so far poorly predicted the success of bioactive implant surfaces. In this report, we screened a library of randomly selected designed surface topographies for those inducing osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Cell shape features, surface design parameters, and osteogenic marker expression were strongly correlated in vitro. Furthermore, the surfaces with the highest osteogenic potential in vitro also demonstrated their osteogenic effect in vivo: these indeed strongly enhanced bone bonding in a rabbit femur model. Our work shows that by giving stem cells specific physicochemical parameters through designed surface topographies, differentiation of these cells can be dictated."}, "Design": {"TopoChip screen": "8 Titanium-coated TopoChips, 4356 images (one for each TopoUnit) were acquired for each chip and fluorescence channel, 12 higher-resolution confocal microscopy images to validate morphology on highest and lowest rank surfaces.", "Surface validation": "To study the long-term effect of topographies on osteogenesis, a mineralization experiment with the selected surfaces in osteogenic medium was performed (see flow cytometry and qPCR).

Undifferentiated TSCs were seeded on a TopoChip containing 2176 different topographies in culture medium without differentiation factors, then monitored cell morphology and the levels of ICAM-1, a marker of FRC differentiation. We identified 112 and 72 surfaces that upregulated and downregulated, respectively, ICAM-1 expression. By monitoring cell morphology, and expression of the FRC differentiation marker ICAM-1 via image analysis and machine learning, we discovered correlations between ICAM-1 expression, cell shape and design of surface topographies and confirmed our findings by using flow cytometry."}, "Design": {"Cell culture": "stromal cells were obtained from human tonsils collected from children undergoing routine tonsillectomy.

Mineralization was clearly observed in BM-MSCs but only occasionally detected minerals in TSCs.
