{"Description": {"Name": "Mining for osteogenic surface topographies", "Lead author": "Frits F.B. Hulshof", "Lead principal investigator": "Jan de Boer", "Date": "12 May 2017", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.05.020", "Summary": "Stem cells respond to the physicochemical parameters of the substrate on which they grow. Quantitative material activity relationships ethe relationships between substrate parameters and the phenotypes they induce have so far poorly predicted the success of bioactive implant surfaces. In this report, we screened a library of randomly selected designed surface topographies for those inducing osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Cell shape features, surface design parameters, and osteogenic marker expression were strongly correlated in vitro. Furthermore, the surfaces with the highest osteogenic potential in vitro also demonstrated their osteogenic effect in vivo: these indeed strongly enhanced bone bonding in a rabbit femur model. Our work shows that by giving stem cells specific physicochemical parameters through designed surface topographies, differentiation of these cells can be dictated."}, "Design": {"TopoChip screen": "8 Titanium-coated TopoChips, 4356 images (one for each TopoUnit) were acquired for each chip and fluorescence channel, 12 higher-resolution confocal microscopy images to validate morphology on highest and lowest rank surfaces. The relationship between ALP level and cell shape, we selected the 100 highest and lowest surfaces ranked by ALP intensity. The morphological difference between positive and negative hits are analyzed in more detail by higher-resolution confocal microscopy.", "Surface validation": "To study the long-term effect of topographies on osteogenesis, a mineralization experiment with the selected surfaces in osteogenic medium was performed. ALP expression was verified by flow cytometry in hMSCs after 5 days in medium with osteogenic supplements (see flow cytometry). To test whether enhanced mineralization corresponded to osteogenic differentiation, qPCR has been performed to measure osteogenic markers (see qPCR)", "Titanium implant fabrication": "Annealed Titanium plates of 99.6% purity of 150 nm x 150 nm and thickness of 2 mm were bought from Goodfellow (UK). Titanium plates were laser-cut into 100 nm diameter substrates. After a pre-polish step using polishing paste, Titanium substrates were final polished to achieve a roughness of about 10 nm by chemical mechanical polishing.", "Flow cytometry": "hMSCs were seeded at a density of 3500 cells/cm2 on enlarged sufaces of the selected patterns and culured for 5 days in basic medium without osteogenesis-stimulating compounds. After 5 days, cells were harvested and stained with anti-human ALP  antibody.", "qPCR": "total RNA was isolated to quantify Osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), and bone sialoprotein (BSP) transcripts from hMSCs cultured for 5 weeks on the selected topographies in osteogenic conditions.", "Animal surgery": "Titanium implants were surgically implanted in 24 New Zealand White female rabbits. For each time point (4 and 8 weeks) 12 rabbits were used. For each rabbit two implants were inserted in to each femur for a total of 4 implants per rabbit. From the resulting total of 8 replicates per topography, 4 were used for the pull-out tests and 4 were used for histological analysis.", "Tensile test": "At four and eight weeks after implantation, a tensile test is performed to measure the force required for detachment of the implant", "Histology methods": "histology images are made for bone slices with a non-patterned substrate after 4 weeks of implantation and a SLA substrate after 8 weeks of implantation, and a low ALP hit topography substrate after 4 weeks of implantation."}, "Results": {"selected surfaces": "T2-PLA-Ti-3322,T2-PLA-Ti-0205,T2-PLA-Ti-0304,T2-PLA-Ti-1642,T2-PLA-Ti-3240,T2-PLA-Ti-2702,T2-PLA-Ti-1901", "ImageForSurfaces": "TRUE", "gene expression": "Both ALP-high surfaces (4 and 8) showed large upregulation of Osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), and bone sialoprotein (BSP) transcripts relative to the non-patterned control, whereas surface 7 showed intermediate values."}}
