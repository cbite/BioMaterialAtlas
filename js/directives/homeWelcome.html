                <p class=card-text>The Biomaterial Atlas is a repository with data on biomaterialâ€“cell interactions from a multi-disciplinary field. It contains information on biomaterial properties for regulating cell-material interactions, mechanical factors influencing soft tissue, and surface topologies to control cell fate. The creation of biomaterials suited for clinical application is a major challenge because of our current knowledge gap on cellular interactions and biomaterial characteristics. The Biomaterials Atlas offers a repository to explore those interactions, to further investigate the role of material on cellular response and characteristics. The scope of the Biomaterials Atlas is to collect data and provide researchers with existing knowledge to define new hypotheses.</p>
