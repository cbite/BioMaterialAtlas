On the ventricular side, patchy endothelium was detected near the hinge region, but not near the free edge. After 12 months, a near-confluent endothelial layer was observed on both the pulmonary and the ventricular surfaces, although localized uncovered regions were detected, mainly near the free edge.", "Formation and composition of neo-tissue": "Analogous to the cell colonization, profound valve remodeling was seen at the tissue level. . At 6 months follow-up, collagen was mainly deposited as a neo-tissue layer onto the scaffold the pulmonary side of the leaflet. Minor collagen deposition was detected inside the scaffold, in particular near the hinge region. At 12 months follow-up, collagen deposition inside the scaffold was more pronounced, also in the belly region, and a remodeling region was observed near the hinge region.GAGs were observed in and on the scaffold at both the 6- and the 12-months explants. Biochemical analysis revealed no significant differences in tissue composition between 6- and 12-months explants, although collagen content at 6 months was less than native. At 12 months follow-up, the tissue was composed of DNA, GAGs, collagen, and (tropo)elastin at concentrations comparable to the native pulmonary leaflet.", "Elastic fiber formation": "Expression of the (tropo)elastin protein strongly co-localized with collagen expression. At 6 months, coexpression of fibrillin-1 and (tropo)elastin and mature elastic fibers were only detected on the pulmonary side of the leaflet. At 12 months, elastic fiber formation was observed on both sides of the leaflet, albeit more pronounced on the pulmonary side. On the ventricular side, elastic fiber formation was limited to the hinge region.", "Scaffold degradation": "The remaining polymer scaffold displayed a modest decrease in molecular weight, but a clear change in the molecular weight distribution (dispersity D), indicating that the remaining material has been affected. Histological analysis revealed that, after 12 months, the PC-BU had specifically disappeared from the section at the base of the leaflet, a section in which cells are relatively abundant.", "Mechanical propoerties explants": "Starting from an almost linear elastic material behavior of the PC-BU starter matrix, the explanted valves displayed a more tissue-like non-linear elastic behavior, albeit with a higher stiffness compared to the native pulmonary valve.", "ImageOfValves": "TRUE", "ImageStudyDesign": "iValve1_surgical.png,iValve1_surgical_scheme.png,iValve1_GrossAppearance_6months.png,iValve1_GrossAppearance_12months.png,iValve1_NeoTissue_6Months.png,iValve1_NeoTissue_12Months.png"}, "Images": {"ImagesToDisplay": "TRUE", "ImagesStudyDesign": "iValve1_transapical.png,iValve1_transapical_scheme.png"}}, "iValve2": {"Description": {"Name": "Bone Marrow Cell Pre-Seeded Versus Nonseeded Bioresorbable Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacements", "Project": "iValve2", "Lead author": "Emanuela S.

We also showed heterogeneous valve and leaflet remodeling, which affects PC-BU TEHV safety, challenging their potential for clinical translation. We suggest that bone marrow mononuclear cell pre-seeding should not be used in combination with PC-BU TEHVs. A better understanding of cell\u2013scaffold interaction and in situ remodeling processes is needed to improve transcatheter valve design and polymer absorption rates for a safe and clinically relevant translation of this approach."}, "Design": {"Implantation method": "Minimally invasive transapical", "Implantation position": "Pulmonary position", "Scaffold": "PCU-131 scaffold in nitinol stent (pre-shaped with insert) with and without bone marrow mononuclear cells.", "Cell Culture": "Autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated via density gradient centrifugation from bone marrow aspirate were seeded onto the scaffolds (n=8).", "In vivo valve functionality assessment": "Transesophageal echocardiography was used post-operatively and at 4,12, and 24 weeks'follow-up to verify tissue engineered heart valve functionality.

For both pre-seeded and nonseeded valves, vimentin-positive host cells were detected at the interface between the pannus and the scaffold material.
