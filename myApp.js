Current in vitro models of liver related diseases do not consider how topographical features used for cell culture can greatly impact  different aspects of cell behavior such as cell differentiation, proliferation and survival. In this work we propose the use of a custom designed polystyrene cell culture surface topography that does enable long-term cultivation of primary hepatocytes with maintenance of phenotypical stability and viability. Our results show that hepatocytes cultured on topographies can maintain the expression of hepatic genetic markers alongside a strongly enhanced protein production capacity, drug metabolism functionality and sensitivity to toxins compared to current in vitro liver models for up to 4 weeks. Our custom made topographic-featuring plates can be used easily  with existing standardized cell culture protocols representing an innovative and powerful tool for long-term in vitro studies using primary hepatocytes within routine high-throughput screenings and for more specific disease models including infection.',cellline:"Hepatocytes",leadauthor:'J. de Boer',leadpi:'J. de Boer',technology:'TopoChip',topochip:"Polystyrene TopoChip",staining:'Dapi (Nuclei), CD81 (Hepatocyte marker), Phalloidin (F-actin)',channels:'DAPI,FITC,TXred',chipreplicate:'10',selectedsurfaces:"1033,824,1213"}

Clustering the surfaces into 28 archetypical cell shapes, we found a very strict correlation between cell shape and physiological response and selected seven cell shapes to describe the molecular mechanism leading to phenotypic diversity. Transcriptomics analysis revealed a tight link between cell shape, molecular signatures, and phenotype.',selectedsurfaces:"1553,342,987,756,2311"}
